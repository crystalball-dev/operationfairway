/**
 * Merchandise, across the whole roster.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Each item links out to where it is actually sold. Items with
 * `available: false` render as sold out and aren't clickable. Names follow
 * the house style: record titles in allcaps. `artist` is the slug from
 * artists.ts; omit it for label merch.
 *
 * Product photos from stores (Kunaki, Amazon) usually sit on a white
 * background; the merch card places them on a light panel and blends the
 * white away, so drop the store's image in as-is. Put images in
 * /public/merch with a content hash in the filename, since that folder is
 * served with immutable caching.
 *
 * All Kunaki listings: https://kunaki.com/msales.asp?PublisherId=249214&pp=1
